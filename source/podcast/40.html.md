We talk about some of the quirks in Apple's developer ecosystem before unpacking some of the interesting language features Swift has to offer. We discuss topics such as tuples, pattern matching, generics, error handling and semicolons. There has also been talk about Swift 2.0's Linux compatibility and we discuss some of Simon's R&D into using Swift on the server side as well.
